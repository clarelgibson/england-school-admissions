# Introduction
This notebook serves as the documented code to read and prepare data for the England School Admissions Dashboard project ([github](https://github.com/clarelgibson/england-school-admissions) | [tableau](https://public.tableau.com/views/Schools_16505251102060/Home?:language=en-GB&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link)).

I begin by reading in the raw data required for the dashboards. I then explain my intended approach to convert the raw data into a "star-schema" dimensional model, using conformed dimensions to serve multiple fact tables. Finally I work through the data wrangling steps necessary to prepare the dimensional model.
